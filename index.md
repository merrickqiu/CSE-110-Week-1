Hello, my name is **Merrick** and I am a student at *UC San Diego*.

I like Einstein's quote about stupidity because its very applicable to programing
> Two things are infinite:
> The Universe and Human Stupidity;
> And I'm not sure about the universe. 
>
> Albert Einstein

I think quines are pretty cool. 
Here is an example of one in python:
```python
_='_=%r;print (_%%_)';print (_%_)
```

As you can tell by the picture at top, I like [Elephants.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant)
